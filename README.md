## Example of Neural Network models of social and personality psychology phenomena ##

This repository gathers a collection of neural network models of various social and personality psychology phenomena built by Stephen J. Read in the new *go* based version of the Leabra neural network modeling architecture.  This software architecture has been built by Randy O'Reilly at the University of California, Davis.
