## Example of Neural Network models of social and personality psychology phenomena ##

This repository gathers a collection of neural network models of various social and personality psychology phenomena built by Stephen J. Read in the new *go* based version of the Leabra neural network modeling architecture.  This software architecture has been built by Randy O'Reilly at the University of California, Davis.  

Information about the Leabra modeling system can be found at the *emergent* Wiki:

and in the Leabra repository:

The repository currently has the following models
- **StereotypeModel** - This is a simple example model of stereotyping/classification of different individuals
- **PersonPerception** - This a *go* implementation of a constraint satisfaction model of PersonPerception based on Freeman and Ambady's person construal model in their 2011 *Psychological Review* Article.
- **IRmodel** - This is a neural network implemention of Cunningham and Zelazo's Iterative Reprocessing model of social evaluation.  
- **BeanFest** - This is an implementation of Eiser and Fazio's BeanFest reward learning game, which models reinforcement learning in a game in which individuals need to learn whether different beans are good or bad.
- **Personality** - This a version of Read and Millers (2021a,b) Virtual Personality Model, built in *go*.
- **Dynamics** - This a version of Read and Miller's (2021a,b) Virtual Personality Model that simulates an individual's interactions with their situation. This is implemented in *go*.
